### File_Integrity_Checker

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)


 A Python-based project that verifies the integrity of files in a directory by comparing **SHA-256 hash values**.
This project was developed as part of a **Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking Internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT. LTD.** to demonstrate file verification and data security techniques.
---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on maintaining **data integrity** by detecting any unauthorized modifications, additions, or deletions in files.
It works by generating hash values for each file and comparing them with previously stored hashes to verify changes over time.
